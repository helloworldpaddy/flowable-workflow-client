Dr. Johnson reported a pattern of inappropriate behavior by her colleague Michael Wilson, SVP in Investment Banking, spanning multiple areas of concern.\n\nThe initial complaint focused on workplace harassment and discrimination but subsequent investigation revealed additional serious violations including financial fraud and information security breaches. The complainant has provided detailed documentation and is willing to cooperate fully with the investigation.\n\nDr. Johnson expressed concerns about potential retaliation and requested confidential handling of her identity until formal proceedings begin. She has been advised of available protections and support resources.\n\nThis case requires immediate attention given the seriority of the allegations, the seniority of the individuals involved, and the potential legal and regulatory implications. Multi-department coordination will be essential for a thorough investigation.",

Preliminary findings expected within 10 business days.\n\nSpecial considerations: Given the seniority of individuals involved and potential media interest, all activities must be conducted with utmost discretion and proper documentation.",

Quantify total financial impact\n2. Assess internal control failures\n3. Coordinate with external counsel if criminal referral needed\n4.
