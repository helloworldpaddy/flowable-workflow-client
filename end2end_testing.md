## Technical Notes

### JWT Token Management:
- Tokens expire after 24 hours
- Each user role has specific permissions
- Authorization header format: `Bearer {token}`

### Task Identification Process:
1. Query `act_ru_task` table for active tasks
2. Match tasks by `candidate_group` or `assignee`
3. Use `task_id` (UUID) for completion API calls
4. Verify completion in `act_hi_taskinst` table

### Database Schema Usage:
- **Application Tables:** 16 tables in `cms_flowable_workflow` schema
- **Flowable Tables:** Engine tables with `act_` prefix
- **Key Tables:** cases, allegations, work_items, users, roles

### Workflow Engine Integration:
- BPMN 2.0 process definitions
- DMN decision tables for allegation classification
- Automatic task assignment based on allegation types
- Process variables carry case context through workflow

## 📊 Task Identification Process Explained:

### How Task IDs are Identified:
1. **Database Query:** Query `act_ru_task` table for active tasks
2. **Filter by Time:** `WHERE create_time_ > '2025-07-03 08:00:00'`
3. **Task ID Extraction:** Use `id_` field as unique task identifier
4. **Task Assignment:** Match with candidate groups or assignees
5. **Process Linking:** Use `proc_inst_id_` to link to process instance

### Task Completion Flow:
```
Task ID → Authentication → Complete Task API → Update Variables → Next Task Creation
```

### REST API Completion Pattern:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/workflow/tasks/{TASK_ID}/complete" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer {USER_TOKEN}" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "variable1": "value1",
  "variable2": "value2"
}'
```

-- Verify process completion
SELECT proc_inst_id_, end_time_, duration_
FROM act_hi_procinst 
WHERE business_key_ = 'CMS-2025-008' 
AND end_time_ IS NOT NULL;

-- Verify all tasks completed
